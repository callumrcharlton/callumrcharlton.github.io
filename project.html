            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p>An economic problem faced by many people today is the cost-of-living crisis. The rising energy prices have garnered lots of media attention and there is concern the high rate of inflation is not being accompanied by an appropriate rise in wages. This project looks to investigate the extent at which house prices are increasing disproportionately more than wages and I will then look to discuss the significance of these effects on different age demographics in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The first chart tracks the cumulative goals scored for home and away teams in the Premier League.</p>
