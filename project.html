            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p>An economic problem faced by many people today is the cost-of-living crisis. The rising energy prices have garnered lots of media attention and there is concern the high rate of inflation is not being accompanied by an appropriate rise in wages. This project looks to investigate the extent at which house prices are increasing disproportionately more than wages and I will then look to discuss the significance of these effects on different age demographics in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> </div>
            <p>From Figure 1, we can clearly see that the index of house prices has been increasing at a higher rate over this time period than wages. To gain further insight, I will gather more detailed data broken down by geographical region.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
            <p>Figures 2 and 3 visualise the change in wages and house prices, respectively, over time. The country has been divided into local districts and offer a comparison of the relative changes among regions. From this data, it is clear that both variables increase over time. However, it isn't clear that house prices are rising significantly quicker than each district's income. Therefore, I will look at a selection of districts from across the country to see if there are any trends.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
            <p>This trellis chart highlights some variation seen within the data. Here, there is evidence to suggest that, as a proportion of income, house prices seem to be fairly stable in the north. Conversely, the rate of increase for house prices is southern regions is faster than income. Now we have an idea of how house prices vary by geographical region, we can investigate the extent of how the younger demographic is affected.</p>
